in this repeat sales item, we are simulating the case where sales item is repeat.

Means: same customer, different sales order, same template sales item. Difference: quantity
price


We want to simulate these things:
0. Fixing the sales item update 
		>>. In the same sales order, customer wants to change service level. 
			Case 1: production + post production => production only 
			
			Case 2: production => production + post production
			
			Case 3 (can't happen): post_production => production + post_production 

1. Repeat Sales Item with different service level. 
		a. In sales_order #1 & #2, it requires production only  (DONE)
			# see: spec/model/repeat_sales_item/complete_similar_repeat_no_post_prod_spec.rb
			
		b. In sales_order #1 & #2, it requires production + post_production   (DONE) 
			# see: spec/model/repeat_sales_item/complete_similar_repeat_with_post_prod_spec.rb
		
		c. In sales_order #1 & #2, it requires post_production only 
			 
			
			
		
		
		
		d. In sales order #1 => it requires production only 
			 In sales order #2 => it requires both production and post production
			 In sales order #3 => it requires production only. HOW?
			
	
		
			
		xx. Impossible case. must be blocked => from post_production only => production + post_production
		# must create new sales item 
		
		
2. Effect on  
	a. SubcriptionProductionHistory, SubcriptionPostProductionHistory  in the case with no changes
				in the service level
				
	b. If there is changes in service level  ( try case 1b ) 
	
3. Loose Delivery: you can just send out any items. 
		 # so , if it is only at production. But the customer wants to rush it up..
		# send it while it is in production, reduce the pending post production ... hheheh! 
		# mark the loose delivery entry => to peg the pending post_production
